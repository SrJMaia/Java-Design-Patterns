## SOLID

S -> Solid resposibility principle
	- There should never be more than one reason for a class to change
	- Focused, single functionality addresses a specific concern
O -> Open closed principle
	- Softwware entities(Classes, Modules, Methods etc) should
	be open for extension, but closed for motification
	- Abstract class
L -> Liskov substitution principle
	- We should be to substitute base class objects with child class
	objects & this should not alter behavior/characteristics of program
I -> Interface segregation principle
	- Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces
	that they do not use
D -> Dependency inversion principle
	- A. Hiigh level modules should not depend upon low level modules.
	Noth should depend upon abstractions
	- B. Abstractions should not depend upon datails. Details should
	depend upon abtraction
